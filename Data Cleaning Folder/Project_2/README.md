# Data Cleaning Project 2
A SQL data cleaning project

## Introduction
Another small SQL Data cleaning project 

## Problem Statement

In Data Analysis, the analyst must ensure that the data is 'clean' before doing any analysis.  'Dirty' data can lead to unreliable, inaccurate and/or misleading results.  Garbage in = garbage out. The following steps shall be conducted:

- Check for duplicate entries and remove them.
- Remove extra spaces and/or other invalid characters.
- Separate or combine values as needed.
- Ensure that certain values (age, dates...) are within certain range.
- Check for outliers.
- Correct incorrect spelling or inputted data.
- Adding new and relevant rows or columns to the new dataset.
- Check for null or empty values.

## Datasets used
This dataset contains one csv file named '[club_member_info](https://github.com/shandarren/resume/blob/main/Data%20Cleaning%20Folder/Project_2/club_member_info.csv)'.
